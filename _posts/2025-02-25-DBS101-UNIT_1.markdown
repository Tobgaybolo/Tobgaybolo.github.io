<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he world has now reached a point where technology has become the core that is controlling everything that we use in our day-to-day life. And for technology to work one thing is needed and is also referred now as the new gold that is data. Database system is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access thoes data and playes the key role for managing the data across the industries.</p>

### Objective:
- Understand the purpose of database system.
- Identify the use of database system.
- Understand the evolution of database system.
- Describe different types of data models used in
  database design.
- Discuss the key responsibilities of database
  administrators.

## Lesson 1:

---

### What is data?
-> Data is collection of facts.

### What is a database system?
-> Database system is combination of well organized collection of data and a Database Management system.

### Advantages of Database system:
- Data consistency: ensures an accurate and up-to-date infpormation
- Scalability and flexibility: supports the increasing amount of data
- Reduction in data redundancy: avoids duplication and inconsistencies in the data
- Better security: implements acces controls and authentications
- Data Abstraction: simplifies data interactions for the end-users while mentaining a complex underlying structure

## Lesson 2:

---

### Types of data models:
- Entity-Relationship Model: is a model for identifying entities (like student, car or company) to be represented in the database and representation of how those entities are related.

- Semi-structured Data Model: is data that does not conform to a data model but has some structure.

- Object Based Data Models: Combination of Object Oriented Programming + Relational database model.

- Relational Model: represents data and their relationships through a collection of tables.

### How Database systems become easier?
- In early times DBMS was really difficult to build and maintian, programmers had to knowwhat queries(requests on
data) the application would execute before they could deploy the data base. But in 1969 the introduction of Edgar F. Codd's Relational model, which uses table and SQL(Sequential Query Language) as query language, made it much easier for the users.

### Functional Components of a database system:
1. Storage Manager: provides the interface between the
low-level data stored in the database and the
application programs and queries submitted to the
system.
2. Query Processor: The query processor components
include: DDL interpreter, DML compiler and Query
evaluation engine.
3. Transaction Management: The transaction manager
consists of the concurrency-control manager and the
recovery manager
